Considering individual landmarks for resampling and relative supports
 
   Settings for landmark optimization:  
      Initially approximmating landmark positions with a 6x6 grid 
      Adding terminal points to initial grid 
      Not shrinking frame when approximmating landmark positions 
      Not skipping cells when approximmating landmark positions 
      Not shaking grid 
      Nesting sankoff 1 times (window: 1.0000 cells) 
      Using iterative-pass (max. iters. 100000, cut 0.00000100) 

   Settings for searches:
      Using a tolerance margin of 15.00% maximum.
      Error stages:
           - 0.00 for 0 to 15% of swapping,
           - 5.00 from 15% to 66%,
           - 15.00 from 66% to completion 
      Refining first guess with incremental fermat recalculation, 5 nodes
      from point of reinsertion, with up to 2 iterations 
 
   To calculate total score, all landmarks within a character equally weighted 
   For resampling and support, using individual landmarks

Trees rooted using single outgroup due to TNT limitations, may need to re-root later
Log file is a text file showing tree statistics for the MP tree(s) - usually single tree in GM - first tree is called Tree 0
Adjusted homoplasy is based on default K=3, use PIWE = K to change
Dataset1_ancestralConfigs.tps is a tps file has a table of ancestral configurations
Dataset1_ancestralConfigs.txt is a text file that has a table of ancestral configurations at each node - the nodes labelled in Dataset1_MP_Tree_nodelabels.trees 
Dataset1_MP_TNTformat.tree is a TNT readable tree
Dataset1_MP_Tree_nodelabels.trees has ancestral nodes numbered, opens in most nexus tree viewers 
Dataset1_MP_Tree1_BranchLengths.tre is a nexus file with branch lengths as annotations, opens in SOME nexus tree viewers eg FigTree1.4.4
