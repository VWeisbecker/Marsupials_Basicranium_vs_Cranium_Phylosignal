Trees rooted using single outgroup due to TNT limitations, may need to re-root later
Log file is a text file showing tree statistics for the MP tree(s) - usually single tree in GM - first tree is called Tree 0
Adjusted homoplasy is based on default K=3, use PIWE = K to change
Dataset1_ancestralConfigs.tps is a tps file has a table of ancestral configurations
Dataset1_ancestralConfigs.txt is a text file that has a table of ancestral configurations at each node - the nodes labelled in Dataset1_MP_Tree_nodelabels.trees 
Dataset1_MP_TNTformat.tree is a TNT readable tree
Dataset1_MP_Tree_nodelabels.trees has ancestral nodes numbered, opens in most nexus tree viewers 
Dataset1_MP_Tree1_BranchLengths.tre is a nexus file with branch lengths as annotations, opens in SOME nexus tree viewers eg FigTree1.4.4
