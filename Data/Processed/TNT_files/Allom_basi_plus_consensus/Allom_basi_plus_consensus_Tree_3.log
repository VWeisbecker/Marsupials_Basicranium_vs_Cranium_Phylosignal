Considering individual landmarks for resampling and relative supports
 
   Settings for landmark optimization:  
      Initially approximmating landmark positions with a 6x6 grid 
      Adding terminal points to initial grid 
      Not shrinking frame when approximmating landmark positions 
      Not skipping cells when approximmating landmark positions 
      Not shaking grid 
      Nesting sankoff 1 times (window: 1.0000 cells) 
      Using iterative-pass (max. iters. 100000, cut 0.00000100) 

   Settings for searches:
      Using a tolerance margin of 15.00% maximum.
      Error stages:
           - 0.00 for 0 to 15% of swapping,
           - 5.00 from 15% to 66%,
           - 15.00 from 66% to completion 
      Refining first guess with incremental fermat recalculation, 5 nodes
      from point of reinsertion, with up to 2 iterations 
 
   To calculate total score, all landmarks within a character equally weighted 
   For resampling and support, using individual landmarks
